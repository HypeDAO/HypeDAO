## Welcome to the HypeDAO API!

### How to get connected to the Postgres database:
* Delete the "example-" from ".example-env" so the file is named ".env". Then contact either Ev3reth or another established developer for the needed environment variables. 

*Please keep these env vars secret and especially off github.*

* Get the ca.pem file from Ev3reth and place it in the top level directory.
